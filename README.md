# Grover-s-Algorithm-Implementation-on-3-qubit-database
I have implemented Grover's algorithm N=8 as database size and the example results are attached. Most of the resources on the internet like the Qiskit text book constructed the circuit which is applicable to a particular target state only, like if you go to the Qiskit textbook you can see the target state for the two-qubit circuit is taken as \(|11>\) and they hard coded the reflection operator and diffusion operator to work with this particular input target state only. So what if you want to apply Grover's algorithm to find the target state \(|00>\) or some other, I have Implemented Grover's algorithm by considering all the possible cases i.e. you can query any random state you wish to search from the database.
